CS 262 - Lab 1 
Seong Chan Cho (sc77)

This lab is based on https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/01introduction/lab.html

This lab creates a basic react native app on expo go, which says hello and tells the user the creator's name. 

App.js - main code of the app, where you can change the content of that app in this file. 
package.json = ot's a JSON file where it holds data, scripts, and versions of the project. if the project releases new versions, package.json will change
node-modules - node_modules are modules downloaded when installing where you can use them as modules in the project. 
.gitignore - git ignore should probably used when classifying which file to be ignored when commiting and pushing your project to git or github.

Exercise 1.1

1. One app I want to create is an app called "everytime" it has features where people school students - only can register and communicate within the app annonymously. In this open social network,
people can buy and sell textbooks, used items, talk about class, review professors, and talk about random stuff. I also hope to implment a page where you can implment a table where you can easily access 
your class schedule by just entering class information with specific time. It will allow people to access their schedule without having to logging in to workday. This app will only be available for calvin students
only and in order to access the app, user will need school id. 

2. Second idea on what I want to build is an app to practice for code testing. I personally think that the perk of mobile application over computer app or web is comparatively easier access and less
restriction when accessing. I want an app where I can practice coding when I am outside without a laptop. Making it simple, I imagine this application to be more like a card quiz based, instead of actually
typing codes. 

Exercise 1.2

1. Demographics
a. I am a Senior in Calvin University
b. I am studying BS Computer Science (2017 catalogue)
c. I believe I got B's in both class

2. Technical 
a. I did an intern in korea during past summer. It was a Web-sheet (like a table) solution company, and they used JS as a main language. Not perfect, but I do have some experience with it. \
   I did use some database, but it was already pre built by the company, and all I did was either copy paste the data first and edited, or used Chrome Dev Tool to get the database from the opened
   window and edited them. So, just some experience I guess
b. I never used slack and Trello, but I did use Git and github. I used git,gitlab,node,js,fork during the internship to work in the team and sync the codes that I push. I haven't used github in 
a team project, but I think it should be relatively simillar to git and gitlab. 
c. I want to work on projects that I mentioned in my exercise 1.1, or a project that I just talked to my roomate David Yoo (gy24) where students can order coffee remotely without having to wait in a line,
or physically being present. I think I will actually really like and enjoy that project. think I will want to make an app among these three ideas. 
3. O = 76, C = 65, E = 87, A = 88, N = 34
a. I would like to work with Gunju (David) Yoo [gy24].  I would like to avoid working with Luz Daniela Contreras Guzman and Germaine Hounakey. 

4. Nothing much.
