1) What do the hooks in this code do?

Hooks are functions that let you hook into React state features from function components; it adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component.

2) Modify the URL to some invalid value and explain how the code responds.

When the url includes extra things at end, the data gets changed. Code will still outputs, but if anything is changed before that, it will be blank. It won't crash, just blank page.
